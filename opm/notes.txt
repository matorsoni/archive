Compiling OPM: run 'install_prereqs.sh' and then 'clone_and_build_opm.sh'

First reservoir simulation with Flow: https://opm-project.org/?page_id=197
./flow opm-data/spe1/SPE1CASE1.DATA
./flow opm-data/norne/NORNE_ATW2013.DATA
(output files are written to the same directory as input data)

Frustrating experience trying to install libecl to visualize data,
this was the best resource from Dr Blatt.
It requires an old version of Conan (<1.59 from what I could gather)
for the cmake build to work.
